# busylight-controller
A simple C# app to control the BusyLight presence indicator.  

1. Clone repo
2. Open in VisualStudio 2013
3. Build & Run
4. Marvel at the ease that you can set your BusyLight's status

I built this to override my BusyLight's status, so my family can know when I'm busy and working in my Home Office.

The setup was inspired by Scott Hanselman's article here: www.hanselman.com/blog/IsDaddyOnACallABusyLightPresenceIndicatorForLyncForMyHomeOffice.aspx
